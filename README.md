# FUTURE_ML_02-
In this task, I worked on a large telecom dataset and applied data preprocessing, encoding, and oversampling techniques (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. I built and evaluated models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict which customers are likely to leave the service.
Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains the complete work for Task 2 of the Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns.

Overview
The goal was to build a model to predict which customers are likely to churn (leave) their telecom service.

Dataset
The dataset contains 243,553 records with customer demographics, usage data, and churn labels.

Approach
Data cleaning and preprocessing including encoding categorical features.

Handling class imbalance using SMOTE oversampling.

Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.

Performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Conclusion
This task helped me understand challenges in real-world churn prediction problems and machine learning model evaluation.
